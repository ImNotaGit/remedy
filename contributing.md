Thanks a lot for your contribution!

Before opening a Pull Request, be sure that:

+ [ ] binding functions have a trailing `r` (for example `listr()` or `urlr()`) 

+ [ ] documentation contain example (CRAN forces examples for the addins)

+ [ ] you've updated the binding field in addins.dcf

+ [ ] you've added element to hotkey field in [opts.R](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/remedy/blob/master/R/opts.R#L78). Name of element function name without the trailing `r`.

+ [ ] you've added suggested hotkey for macOS, this is for when end users add hotkeys in bulk and use `remedy::remedy_opts$get("hotkeys")`

+ [ ] you've added unit tests in testthat

+ [ ] you've run covrpage `covrpage::covrpage(update_badge = TRUE,vignette = TRUE)` locally since ci can't run the unit tests for addins.
